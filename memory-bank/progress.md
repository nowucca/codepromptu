## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Microservices Architecture**: 
   - Decision: Split into 5 core services (gateway, processor, api, worker, config)
   - Rationale: Enables independent scaling and development
   - Date: January 2025

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Backend: Java Spring Boot 3.2+ with Spring AI
   - Database: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension
   - Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript
   - Infrastructure: Docker + Kubernetes
   - Rationale: Mature ecosystem with strong LLM integration support
   - Date: January 2025

3. **Vector Similarity Strategy**:
   - Embedding Model: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dimensions)
   - Similarity Thresholds: Same ≥0.95, Fork 0.70-0.95, New <0.70
   - Index: pgvector with IVFFlat
   - Rationale: Proven performance with good accuracy/speed balance
   - Date: January 2025

### Implementation Decisions
1. **Zero-Touch Capture**:
   - Approach: API Gateway proxy with transparent forwarding
   - Client Integration: Base URL configuration only
   - Rationale: Minimal friction for adoption
   - Date: January 2025

2. **Template Induction**:
   - Algorithm: Clustering + Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
   - Processing: Background jobs with Spring Batch
   - Rationale: Balances accuracy with performance
   - Date: January 2025

3. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Primary: JWT with Spring Security
   - Enterprise: OIDC/SAML integration support
   - API Keys: Client provider keys passed through
   - Rationale: Flexible security model for different deployment scenarios
   - Date: January 2025

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Critical Issues
1. **Spring Cloud Config Bootstrap Failures** ✅
   - **Status**: RESOLVED (July 25-27, 2025)
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Services cannot load centralized configuration
   - **Root Cause**: Configuration approach conflicts between Spring Boot 2.4+ import and traditional bootstrap
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive Spring Cloud Config solution with proper bootstrap configuration
   - **Reference**: `narrative-spring-cloud-config-success.md`

2. **Redis Health Check Failures** ✅
   - **Status**: RESOLVED (July 25-27, 2025)
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM - Health checks fail but Redis infrastructure is healthy
   - **Root Cause**: Services defaulting to localhost:6379 instead of cache:6379 due to config bootstrap failures
   - **Solution**: Added custom Redis health indicators and proper configuration management
   - **Reference**: `narrative-custom-redis-health-indicators-success.md`

3. **Embedding Storage Issue** ✅
   - **Status**: COMPLETELY RESOLVED (July 29, 2025)
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Similarity search non-functional due to missing embeddings
   - **Root Cause**: Database index constraint prevented 1536-dimensional vectors + Hibernate PGvector type mapping failures
   - **Infrastructure Solution**: Comprehensive automatic embedding index management system implemented
   - **Final Solution**: Complete migration from Hibernate to JDBC Template eliminated all type mapping issues
   - **Reference**: `narrative-hibernate-to-jdbc-migration-complete.md`

4. **Hibernate PGvector Type Mapping Failures** ✅
   - **Status**: RESOLVED via Architecture Migration (July 29, 2025)
   - **Impact**: CRITICAL - Complex type mapping issues causing embedding storage failures
   - **Root Cause**: Hibernate's type system incompatible with PostgreSQL pgvector extension
   - **Solution**: Complete migration to JDBC Template with custom row mappers
   - **Benefits**: Improved performance, reliability, and maintainability
   - **Reference**: `narrative-hibernate-to-jdbc-migration-complete.md`

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Embedding Model**: No support for model migration or multiple models
   - Impact: Medium - limits flexibility for different use cases

2. **Synchronous Processing**: Some operations may block request threads
   - Impact: High - could affect API response times
   - Plan: Implement async processing with message queues

3. **Manual Threshold Configuration**: Similarity thresholds require manual tuning
   - Impact: Low - affects accuracy but system remains functional
   - Plan: Implement ML-based auto-tuning in future release

   - Effort: 1 week
   - Plan: Add Prometheus/Grafana integration in Phase 2

4. **Security**: Basic authentication, need enterprise-grade security
   - Priority: High for production
   - Effort: 3 weeks
   - Plan: Implement RBAC and audit logging in Phase 2
