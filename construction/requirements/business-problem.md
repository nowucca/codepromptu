## 📄 Business Problem Statement: CodePromptu

**Situation**
Prompt engineering has become central to how developers interact with large language models (LLMs), but today’s practices are ad hoc. Prompts are often created, evaluated, and reused in isolation — spread across personal notes, Slack threads, and temporary documents.

**Problem**
Without structured tooling, prompts become hard to track, improve, or share. Engineers waste time duplicating efforts, struggle to reproduce past results, and can't easily compare or evolve prompts as models change or use cases evolve.

**Implication**
This fragmentation leads to:

- Repeated mistakes and reinvention.
- Poor cross-team visibility.
- Inconsistent LLM performance in production.

**Benefit**
By capturing prompts along with context, usage data, and lineage, CodePromptu enables:

- Reliable prompt reuse and refinement.
- Shared evaluation across teams and systems.
- A durable, searchable prompt knowledge base.

**Vision**
A shared, organization-wide system that treats prompts as evolving knowledge artifacts — trackable, forkable, and reusable — supporting LLM development at scale.
